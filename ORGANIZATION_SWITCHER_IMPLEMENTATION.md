### **Models & Policies**
- `app/Models/Organization.php` - Complete organization model with relationships
- `app/Models/User.php` - Enhanced with organization methods and migration logic
- `app/Policies/OrganizationPolicy.php` - Authorization policies

### **Controllers & Middleware**

- `resources/views/backend/layouts/include/header.blade.php` - Enhanced with switcher
- `resources/views/backend/layouts/app.blade.php` - JavaScript integration

### **JavaScript & Assets**
- `public/js/organization-switcher.js` - Complete switching functionality
- AJAX-based switching with loading states and notifications

### **Routes & Configuration**
- `routes/backend.php` - Organization routes integration
- `bootstrap/app.php` - Middleware registration

## üöÄ How It Works

### **Organization Creation Process**
1. SuperAdmin creates new organization via form
2. System generates unique database name
3. Creates separate database for organization
4. Clones main database structure to new database
5. Organization becomes available for switching

### **Organization Switching Process**
1. User clicks organization in header dropdown
2. JavaScript sends AJAX request to switch endpoint
3. Server validates user permissions
4. Updates user's current organization context
5. Migrates user/roles to target organization database
6. Middleware switches database context on next request
7. Page reloads with new organization context

### **Database Context Management**
1. Middleware checks user's current organization
2. Dynamically switches database connection
3. All queries automatically use organization database
4. Maintains session state across requests
5. Handles fallback scenarios gracefully

## üîß Technical Architecture

### **Multi-Database Strategy**
- **Main Database**: Stores organizations and user mappings
- **Organization Databases**: Separate database per organization
- **Dynamic Switching**: Runtime database connection switching
- **Structure Cloning**: Automated database structure replication

### **User Migration Logic**
- **Role Preservation**: Maintains all user roles across organizations
- **Permission Sync**: Synchronizes permissions between databases
- **Conflict Handling**: Manages existing users in target organizations
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive migration activity logging

### **Security Implementation**
- **Authorization Layers**: Multiple authorization checkpoints
- **Role Validation**: SuperAdmin role requirement for management
- **Access Control**: Organization-specific access validation
- **Input Sanitization**: Complete input validation and sanitization

## üìã Usage Instructions
